== '''Simple Rules''' ==

=== '''Vandalism''' === 
Obviously, we do not allow vandalism of any kind - users (or IP Addresses) found in violation of this rule will find them self with a nice IP ban.


=== '''Advertising''' === 
Attempting to advertise other sites outside of the wiki that do not provide educational benefits is strictly prohibited.


=== '''Download Links/Uploads''' === 
Any link or upload that contains copywrited material (ex: a client revision or cache archive) is strictly prohibited and will be removed along with a punishment for the user; this is your only warning.


=== '''Posting Unreliable Information''' === 
The wiki is an education resource, so posting misinformed information is not optimal for learning - please avoid this. This includes edits with unclear explanations or bad information.

=== '''Proprietary Code'''===
No server-specific code, only easily interpretable pseudo-code.
