== Construct Map Region ==

=== Description ===

The construct map region packet sends a dynamic map region that is constructed by using groups of 8*8 tiles. It is generally used for instanced areas, such as fight caves, and in later revisions, player owned houses.

==== Bit block ====

The bit block actually contains the 'palette' of map regions to make up the new region.

There is a loop, like this, used to construct it:

 for(int z = 0; z < 4; z++) {
  for(int x = 0; x < 13; x++) {
   for(int y = 0; y < 13; y++) {
    // data for this region
   }
  }
 }

The individual format in each iteration of the loop is:

* '''1 bit''' - set to 0 to indicate to display nothing, 1 to display a region
* '''26 bits''' - if the flag above is set to 1 - region x << 14 | region y << 3
