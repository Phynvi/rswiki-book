== Send ignored users ==

=== Description ===

Sends the IDs of all the users that this player has in their ignore.

This packet has a slightly different structure than the other packets.

NOTE: Due to my lack of knowledge about Wiki syntax, I am not sure how to wrap the following text in [code] tags.

int entries = packetSize / 8;
for (int i = 0; i < entries; i++) {
    ignoreList[i] = stream.readLong();
}

By looking at the rest of the 317 protocol, there doesn't seem to be a way to change the list dynamically. It seems as though that whenever the player decides to add or remove a player from their list, it must send all the values again.
