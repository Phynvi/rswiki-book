== Construct Map Region ==

=== Description ===

This packet constructs the map region.

=== Packet Structure ===
{|border=2
! Data Type
! Description
|-
| [[Data Types#Standard data types|Additional Short]]
| The players region y plus 6.
|-
| [[Data Types#Standard data types|Short]]
| The players region x plus 6.
|-
|}

=== Other Information ===

After the region y is sent, you need to initialize the bit access. Then, loop through the z (which can only go up to 3). Still in the for-loop, you need to go through the x's (up to 12). Then, loop through the y's (up to 12).

All of this is in the all three for-loops! 
Step 1: Then you'll get the tile of x, y, and z.

Step 2: Then you need to send the bits 1 and (if tile is null) 1 otherwise, 0.

Step 3: Check if the tile is not null. Within this if-statement, you put these bits...

{|border=2
! Method
|-
| putBits(26, tile.getX() << 14 | tile.getY() << 3 | tile.getZ() << 24 | tile.getRotation() << 1)
|-
|}

Out of the for-loops!

Step 1: Finish the bit access and send the region x.

Done.
