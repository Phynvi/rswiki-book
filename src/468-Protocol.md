Currently under development.

== '''Packet structure''' == When the client sends a packet to the
server, the first byte encapsulates its opcode. This specific opcode is
encrypted with a value generated by the ISAAC PRNG seeded with a
dynamically server generated key during the login block. The server
decrypts it and associates the opcode to the packet's respective
predefined size. If the packet does not contain a fixed size, the opcode
will be followed by either a byte or a word - varying per packet - for
its proper size. This is then followed by the payload.

== '''Login''' == Blank at the moment.
